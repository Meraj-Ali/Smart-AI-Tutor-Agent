Adaptive Step-by-Step Exercise Assistance**\n\nWhen a topic and difficulty level (e.g., easy, medium, hard) are provided, the system performs the following functions:\n\nExercise Selection: Retrieves or generates exercises that match the specified difficulty and learning objectives.\n\nHint-Based Guidance: Provides incremental hints and step-by-step scaffolding without directly solving the exercise. Each step aims to support learning while preserving student autonomy.\n\nDifficulty Assessment: At each step, evaluates student performance through predefined parameters (e.g., time spent, incorrect attempts, request frequency) to estimate moment-by-moment difficulty.\n\nTargeted Micro-Remediation: If the system detects struggle, it delivers concise, focused learning material related to the specific step or concept causing difficulty.\n\nTeacher Reporting: Automatically generates a structured report summarizing points of difficulty, patterns in student performance, and areas requiring further instruction.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

This means the highest power of the variable (usually 'x') is 2. They have a distinctive U-shape when graphed, called a parabola. The general form of a quadratic function is $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants, and 'a' cannot be zero.\n\nHere's why they are important:\n*   **Shape:** The 'a' value determines if the parabola opens upwards (if 'a' is positive) or downwards (if 'a' is negative). The 'c' value tells you where the parabola crosses the y-axis.\n*   **Real-world uses:** They help model things like the path of a thrown ball or the shape of a satellite dish.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n1.  **Throwing a ball:** The height of a ball thrown upwards can be described by a quadratic function. It goes up, reaches a maximum height, and then comes back down. The function would show this parabolic path.\n2.  **Bridges:** The supporting arches of many bridges are shaped like parabolas, which are graphs of quadratic functions. This shape is strong and efficient for distributing weight.\nBiasCleanerAgent > The provided text on quadratic functions is generally free of bias. The examples used (throwing a ball, bridge arches) are common and neutral applications of the mathematical concept.

The 'c' value indicates the y-intercept.\\n*   **Applications:** Quadratic functions are useful for modeling various real-world phenomena, such as the trajectory of projectiles or the design of structures like satellite dishes and bridge arches.\\n\\n**Examples:**\\n1.  **Projectile Motion:** The path of an object launched into the air (like a ball) can often be represented by a quadratic function, showing its rise to a peak height and subsequent descent.\\n2.  **Structural Design:** The parabolic shape of arches in bridges is a common application of quadratic functions, providing structural strength and efficient weight distribution.\"\n}\n```\n--- Theory for Quadratic Functions ---\n\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.

It takes into account time spent, number of attempts, hints requested, and whether the step was solved correctly.\n\nHow it works:\n\nTime (T) – Ratio of time spent to expected time, capped at 3×.\n\nAttempts (A) – Number of attempts, capped at 2×.\n\nHints (H) – Number of hints requested, capped at 2×.\n\nCorrectness (C) – 0 if correct, 1 if incorrect.\n\nEach factor is weighted: T=45%, A=25%, H=20%, C=10%. The weighted sum is normalized to a 0–100 scale, giving a final difficulty score. (Note: These values should be better computed through machine learning models.)\n\nUse case:\n\n - Identify which steps are easy, moderate, or hard for students.\n\n - Adjust learning paths dynamically based on performance.\n\n - Support adaptive learning systems and analytics.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class DifficultyCalculator:\n    \"\"\"Calculate difficulty score based on student performance metrics\"\"\"\n    \n    @staticmethod\n    def calculate_difficulty(\n        time_spent: float,\n        expected_time: float,\n        attempts: int,\n        hints_requested: int,\n        is_correct: bool\n    ) -> float:\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate difficulty score (0-100) based on student performance.\n        \n        Formula:\n        T = min(t / t_ref, 3)        # Time ratio (capped at 3x)\n        A = min(a / 3, 2)            # Attempts ratio (capped at 2x)\n        H = min(h / 4, 2)            # Hints ratio (capped at 2x)\n        C = 1 - c                    # Correctness (0 if solved, 1 if not)\n        \n        D_raw = 0.45*T + 0.25*A + 0.20*H + 0.10*C\n        D = round((D_raw / max_possible) * 100)\n        \"\"\"\n        # Normalized components (clamped to sensible ranges)\n        T = min(time_spent / expected_time if expected_time > 0 else 1, 3.0)\n        A = min(attempts / 3.0, 2.0)\n        H = min(hints_requested / 4.0, 2.0)\n        C = 0.0 if is_correct else 1.0\n        \n        # Weighted difficulty score\n        weights = {'T': 0.45, 'A': 0.25, 'H': 0.20, 'C': 0.10}\n        D_raw = (weights['T'] * T + weights['A'] * A + \n                 weights['H'] * H + weights['C'] * C)\n        \n        # Normalize to 0-100 scale\n        max_possible = (weights['T'] * 3 + weights['A'] * 2 + \n                       weights['H'] * 2 + weights['C'] * 1)\n        D = round((D_raw / max_possible) * 100)\n        \n        return min(D, 100)\n\n# Test the difficulty calculator\nprint(\"\\n🧮 Testing Difficulty Calculator:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\ntest_cases = [\n    {\"name\": \"Easy step\", \"time\": 30, \"expected\": 30, \"attempts\": 1, \"hints\": 0, \"correct\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Moderate difficulty\", \"time\": 90, \"expected\": 60, \"attempts\": 2, \"hints\": 1, \"correct\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"High difficulty\", \"time\": 180, \"expected\": 60, \"attempts\": 4, \"hints\": 3, \"correct\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Failed step\", \"time\": 120, \"expected\": 60, \"attempts\": 5, \"hints\": 4, \"correct\": False},\n]\n\nfor test in test_cases:\n    score = DifficultyCalculator.calculate_difficulty(\n        test[\"time\"], test[\"expected\"], test[\"attempts\"], \n        test[\"hints\"], test[\"correct\"]\n    )\n    print(f\"{test['name']:20s}: Difficulty Score = {score}/100\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-24T07:57:34.960721Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-24T07:57:34.961019Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-24T07:57:34.980822Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-24T07:57:34.960999Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-24T07:57:34.979634Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n🧮 Testing Difficulty Calculator:\n------------------------------------------------------------\nEasy step           : Difficulty Score = 23/100\nModerate difficulty : Difficulty Score = 38/100\nHigh difficulty     : Difficulty Score = 78/100\nFailed step         : Difficulty Score = 69/100\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**3.3 StepPerformance**\n\nThe StepPerformance class is designed to track and evaluate student performance on a single learning step.
